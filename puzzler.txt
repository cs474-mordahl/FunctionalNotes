I heard this from a woman on the bus the other day.

It was a long, hot summer Sunday. This older couple was sitting in the Sunday Service at their church. 

The old man nods off during the sermon and he falls into a deep sleep.

He dreams that he is involved in the French Revolution. He's one of the leaders in the French Revolution, and he has been brought to the guillotine for execution.

He is about to be executed in this nightmare. Just as he dreams that the blade is falling, his wife notices that her husband is asleep, and she taps him on the back of the neck with her finger to wake him up.

The shock of thinking that the blade has arrived to cut off his head makes him have a heart attack, and he dies on the spot.

And the puzzler is simply this.

What's wrong with this story?
