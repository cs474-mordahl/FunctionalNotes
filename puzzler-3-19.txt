You have two ropes. Each burns completely in exactly one hour. However, they are different lengths and thus burn at different rates. Also, along each rope the width & material changes, so they burn at different rates at different places. The only thing you know is that they each burn completely in one hour exactly.

You only have a lighter. How do you measure exactly 45 minutes?
